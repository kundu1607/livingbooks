            <h2> What do Living Books courses include?</h2>
            Each Living Books course is created, owned and managed by the instructor(s). The foundation of each Living
            Books course are its lectures, which can include videos, slides, and text. In addition, instructors can add
            resources and various types of practice activities, as a way to enhance the learning experience of students.

        <div class="faq1">
            <h2> How do I take a Living Books course?</h2>
            Living Books courses are entirely on-demand and they can be accessed from several different devices and
            platforms, including a desktop, laptop, and our mobile app. After you enroll in a course, you can access it
            by clicking on the course link you will receive in your confirmation email (provided you’re logged into your
            Living Books account). You can also begin the course by logging in and navigating to your My learning page.
